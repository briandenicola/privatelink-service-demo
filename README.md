# Overview

This repository is a demonstration of how to build a locked sandbox environment in Azure leveraging Private Link Scope. It is currently a work in progress

## Required Existing Resources and Configuration
Component | Usage
--------------- | --------------- 
| Two Azure Subscriptions | Application Subscription and Core Subscription |
| Identity granted Owner permissions over each subscription |
| Azure Virtual Network (Core) | A subnet for Private Endpoints |
| Azure VPN Gateway | |
| Azure Firewall Policy | [Required Rules](https://github.com/briandenicola/kubernetes-cluster-setup/blob/main/infrastructure/prereqs/azuredeploy.template.json)
| Private DNS Zones (attached to Core Vnet) | privatelink.azurecr.io |


## Components
Component | Usage
------ | ------
Azure Kubernetes Service | Container Orchestration Runtime Platform  
Azure Cosmos DB | Data storage for application 
Azure Key Vault | Secret store 
Azure Event Hubs | Kafka equivalent resource in Azure
Azure Container Registry | Azure Container Registry for containers
Azure Virtual Network  | Azure Virtual Network for all resources and private endpoints
Azure Private Link Service | Exposes AKS Ingress Control back to your Azure Core

# Infrastructure Deployment 
## Build Environment
```bash
    vi ./infrastructure/azure.tfvars
    #firewall_policy_name                         = "bjdproxy-southcentral-policy"
    #firewall_policy_rg_name                      = "Core_Firewall_RG"
    #core_subscription                            = "43a071dd-5b86-475f-960b-59f814e4f070"
    #core_private_endpoint_virutalnetwork_rg_name = "Core_Network_RG"
    #core_private_endpoint_virutalnetwork_name    = "BJD-Core-VNet-001"
    #core_dns_rg_name                             = "Core_DNS_RG"
    #core_private_endpoint_rg_name                = "Core_PrivateEndpoints_RG"

    az login --scope https://graph.microsoft.com/.default #Code requires AAD permissions 
    task up
```
## Destory Environment
```bash
    az login --scope https://graph.microsoft.com/.default
    task down
```

# Application Deployment
## CI/CD Overview

### Lifecycle
1. Developer checkouts out branch in code repository using Github Codespaces.
1. Developer updates code and develops againist a dedicated mini-cluster either in the Codespace or against AKS in Azure
    * This [repository](https://github.com/briandenicola/codespaces-developer-demo) shows an example of this
1. Developer checks in Code
1. Azure Container Registry has a Build Task configured to monitor for code changes
1. Azure Container Registry builds the application container
1. Developer Updates Helm chart with new container version
1. Flux on the Sandbox AKS cluster monitors for updates for updates to the Helm chart and deploys updated code to the cluster

# Application Troubleshooting 
##  Azure Monitor
* Diagnostic Logging for each Azure resource will be sent to the Sandbox's Log Analtyics resource 
* AKS Cluster Insights is configured to ship node and pod utilization as well as container stdout/stderr to the Sandbox Log Analtyics resource
* Application should include AppInsights SDK or Otel SDK to send application logs to the Sandbox's AppInsights resource
* The environment can be updated to incldue Azure Manage Grafana and Azure Managed Prometheus 

## AKS Run Invoke Command
* The Azure Cli AKS subcommand has the ability to run commands on a private AKS cluster without having direct connectivity.  
* This can be used for one-off commands including viewing logs
```bash
    task run -- "kubectl get nodes"

## Temporary Windows Machine
* At times, VM resources maybe required to do deep dive troubleshooting.  
* This can be accessed through Azure Bastion
* Native tooling can be used with Azure Bastion Standard SKU
    * `az network bastion tunnel` creates a secure tunnel to your VM through Bastion
    * Example: `az network bastion tunnel --name gelding-36358-bastion --resource-group gelding-36358_rg --target-resource-id /subscriptions/17e5343-e92b-4c08-bf19-eb8be6c96991/resourceGroups/gelding-36358_rg/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/gelding-36358-vm --resource-port 22 --port 2222`
    * You then can ssh into the VM with: `ssh admin@127.0.0.1 -p 2222`
* A pre-built Windows 11 VM with all required tooling and Subsystem for Linux installed
    * This [repository](https://github.com/briandenicola/tooling) contains all Windows and Linux tools that I use
    * Shared Image Gallery with Packer is a great way to build the image template to be used. Another example [repository](https://github.com/briandenicola/azure-windows-template-with-packer/tree/main/scripts)
